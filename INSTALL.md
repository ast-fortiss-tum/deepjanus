Installation instructions are offered for both the tools and the experimental evaluation.
For each tool, we provide a default configuration that is the same as the one reported in the manuscript.
* [Instructions for MNIST](/DeepJanus-MNIST/readme.md): the user should expect logging information until the end of the run.
* [Instructions for BeamNG](/DeepJanus-BNG/readme.md): this tool requires the installation of the BeamNG simulator. If installed, the user should expect driving simulations. The underlying algorithm is the same as the previous point.
* [Instructions for experimental evaluation](/experiments/readme.md): we provided our results as input, the expected output is reported in csv files and is coherent with the data reported in the manuscript.
